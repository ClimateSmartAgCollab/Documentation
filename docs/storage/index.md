# Data Storage

## Active Data Storage

Active data is that which is under current collection and analysis.

Recommended is the 3-2-1 rule: Save three copies of your data, on two different storage mediums, and one copy off site.


### Project file organization

Consider specifying file organization (in addition to file naming) conventions. The [TIER protocol](https://www.projecttier.org/tier-protocol/protocol-4-0/) may be a resource to consider for setting up project file structures.

Documentation that meets the specifications of the TIER Protocol contains all the data, scripts, and supporting information necessary to enable you, your instructor, or an interested third party to reproduce all the computations necessary to generate the results you present in the report you write about your project.

## Archive Data Storage

There are many resources available for data storage at the end of a research project. 

**Specialist repostitories** are those that are dedicated to specific kinds of data.

Examples include:
1. GenBank. A comprehensive public repository of DNA sequences maintained by NCBI, supporting genomic and metagenomic research.
2. European Nucleotide Archive (ENA). A resource for raw sequence data, alignments, and assembly data from high-throughput sequencing projects.
3. Sequence Read Archive (SRA). A repository for high-throughput sequencing data, storing raw sequencing reads from genomic studies.
4. MG-RAST (Metagenomics Rapid Annotation using Subsystem Technology). A server for analyzing and archiving metagenomic data, providing functional annotations for microbial communities.
5. EBI Metagenomics. A European Bioinformatics Institute resource that offers tools for the analysis and archiving of metagenomic data.
6. GISAID. A global repository for the sharing of influenza and other viral genome sequences to track and monitor viral evolution.
7. Ag Data Commons. A USDA-managed repository for data related to agriculture, including genomic, phenotypic, and environmental data.
8. ENSEMBL. A genome browser providing detailed annotations and access to eukaryotic genome data.
9. Wheat Initiative's WheatIS. A global wheat data repository for genomic, phenotypic, and breeding data to support agricultural research.

**Generalist Repositories** aren't specific about the type of research data that they host (although they have other limitations such as dataset size).


In Canada most institutions host generalist data repositories, typically [Borealis](https://borealisdata.ca/) (which is derived from Dataverse). Larger datasets can be stored on the [Fedrated Research Data Repository (FRDR)](https://www.frdr-dfdr.ca/repo/).

The advantage of storing in these Canadian repositories is that the data can be catalogued by other services making your data more findable by other researchers. Search Canadian research data using the [Lunaris data search engine](https://www.lunaris.ca/).
