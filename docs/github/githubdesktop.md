GitHub Desktop helps you move your repository contents onto your computer. This is relevant when you want to run the code on your computer for analysis, or if you want to use a text editor on your computer and the web editor of the GitHub webpage isn't sufficient.

First you need to [install GitHub desktop (available for Windows and MacOS)].(https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/installing-and-authenticating-to-github-desktop/installing-github-desktop)

## Link a Repository

On the web, navigate to your GitHub repository that you want to open with GitHub Desktop. From the `<> Code` button, select `Open with GitHub Desktop`. You will begin the process of cloning the repository locally on your computer.
