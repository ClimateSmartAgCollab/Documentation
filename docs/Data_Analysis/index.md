# Data Analysis

## Project file organization

Consider specifying file organization (in addition to file naming) conventions. The TIER protocol may be a resource to consider for setting up project file structures.

Documentation that meets the specifications of the TIER Protocol contains all the data, scripts, and supporting information necessary to enable you, your instructor, or an interested third party to reproduce all the computations necessary to generate the results you present in the report you write about your project.
